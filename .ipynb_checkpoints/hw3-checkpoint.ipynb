Another way to think of it is, to work through the situations of maximum and minimum similarity between two context vectors, starting from the definition above.\n",

    "On my laptop it takes several hundred MB of memory to load it into memory from the `load_contexts()` function. If you don’t have enough memory available, your computer will get very slow because the OS will start swapping. If you have to use a machine without that much memory available, you can instead implement in a streaming approach by using the `stream_contexts()` generator function to access the data; this lets you iterate through the data from disk, one vector at a time, without putting everything into memory. You can see its use in the loading function. (You could also alternatively use a key-value or other type of database, but that’s too much work for this assignment.)"
